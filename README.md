# GameCup 2024

## Getting started
We created a Java example to help you get started with the GameCup 2024. You can change and customize everything you want.

If you need a database or other services, please contact us in your Team specific Discord channel.

## Testing
To test your game locally, you can just run your main class, make sure you put all files that your server creates in the `.gitignore` file.

## Deployment
We automatically deploy your game to our servers when you create a new GitHub release using a custom Docker image. You can edit the `Dockerfile` to your needs.

If you want to add files, like a custom world, a plugin, etc., put them into the `template` folder. If you have any issues, please contact us or check the `Dockerfile`!
